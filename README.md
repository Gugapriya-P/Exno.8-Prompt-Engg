---

## Aim  
To perform the exploration of prompting techniques for audio generation using AI models to create and manipulate various audio contents such as music, sound effects, and voice narration.

## Apparatus / Requirements  

| S.No | Item / Software        | Description |
|------|------------------------|-------------|
| 1    | Computer / Laptop      | With internet connection |
| 2    | Python 3.x / Jupyter    | For running AI scripts |
| 3    | AI Audio Generation API / Model | E.g., OpenAI Audio APIs, Google AudioLM, Meta MusicGen |
| 4    | Audio Player           | To listen to generated outputs |

---

## Algorithm / Procedure  

| Step No. | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 1        | **Select an AI audio generation model** (MusicGen, AudioLM, OpenAI Audio API, etc.). |
| 2        | **Define the objective** of the audio content (music, sound effect, narration). |
| 3        | **Formulate multiple prompts** with varying specificity (short, detailed, style-specific). |
| 4        | **Feed prompts to the model** and generate audio outputs. |
| 5        | **Manipulate the prompt parameters** (tempo, style, emotion, instrument) to explore how the output changes. |
| 6        | **Save the generated audio** and analyze the differences in outputs for each prompt. |
| 7        | **Document the prompts and outputs** in a comparative table. |

## Sample Prompting Table  

| Prompt No. | Prompt Text | Intended Output | Model Used | Observed Result |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| 1 | “Generate a calm piano melody for 30 seconds” | Soft background music | MusicGen | Smooth piano track with slow tempo |
| 2 | “Create a futuristic sci-fi door opening sound effect” | Short SFX clip | AudioLM | Electronic ‘whoosh’ door sound |
| 3 | “Narrate the text ‘Welcome to our lab experiment’ in a female voice” | Voice narration | OpenAI TTS Model | Clear female narration with neutral tone |
| 4 | “Generate an upbeat rock music with drums for 15 seconds” | Energetic music | MusicGen | Fast-paced drum + guitar audio clip |

---

## Observation  

| Prompt Type | Change Made | Effect on Output |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| Detailed vs. Short prompt | Added instrument details and tempo | More accurate and richer output |
| Style Change | Changed from “calm” to “energetic” | Increased tempo and instrument variation |
| Emotion Tags | Added “happy” or “sad” mood | Affected melody structure and tone |

---

## Result  
The prompt exploration for audio generation was executed successfully. Various prompting techniques produced different audio outputs for music, sound effects, and voice narration.

---

## Conclusion  
By experimenting with different prompting strategies, we observed that **prompt specificity, style, and parameters strongly influence the generated audio**. This demonstrates the importance of effective prompt engineering in AI-driven audio generation.
